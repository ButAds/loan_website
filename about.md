# About

The League of Automated Nations records alliance data about the game
[Screeps](https://screeps.com/). It is a community based project that is looking
to start with this site and grow into a full on alliance management tool.


## Help us stay up to date!

This project is currently managed through a website based on Jekyll.

Contributing alliance data can be done by editing [this yaml file](http://www.leagueofautomatednations.com/alliances.js).

Slack network in the channel [#loan]("https://screeps.slack.com/messages/loan/).
